I am happy to announce [ink! 5.0](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases/tag/v5.0.0) support for ink! analyzer -
a collection of modular and reusable libraries and tools for semantic analysis of [ink!](https://use.ink/) smart contracts.

If you're new to ink! analyzer (or if you need a refresher ðŸ™‚), you can refer to the
[introductory blog post](/blog/introducing-ink-analyzer) for a deep dive into the
[problem](/blog/introducing-ink-analyzer#problem), [solution](/blog/introducing-ink-analyzer#solution)
and technical descriptions of each of the [architectural components](/blog/introducing-ink-analyzer#architecture)
of the project.

- Semantic Analyzer ([source code](https://github.com/ink-analyzer/ink-analyzer/tree/master/crates/analyzer),
  [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ink-analyzer), [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ink-analyzer/latest/ink_analyzer/)).
- Language Server ([source code](https://github.com/ink-analyzer/ink-analyzer/tree/master/crates/lsp-server),
  [binary/executable releases](https://github.com/ink-analyzer/ink-analyzer/releases),
  [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ink-lsp-server), [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ink-lsp-server/latest/ink_lsp_server/)).
- Visual Studio Code Extension ([source code](https://github.com/ink-analyzer/ink-vscode),
  [VS Code Marketplace listing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ink-analyzer.ink-analyzer),
  [VSIX releases](https://github.com/ink-analyzer/ink-vscode/releases)).

## What's new?

The latest updates introduce support for [ink! 5.0](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases/tag/v5.0.0)
across all ink! analyzer features and components including:

- Completions for all new ink! 5.0 attribute macros and arguments
  (e.g. `#[ink::event]` attribute macro and its optional `signature_topic = ..` or `anonymous` arguments,
  options for the `#[ink_e2e::test]` macro's new `backend` argument e.t.c).
- Diagnostics and quickfixes for ink! 5.0 entities and syntax based on new semantic rules
  (e.g. improper use of wildcard selectors, missing required `extension = ..` argument for `#[ink::chain_extension]`
  attribute macro, validation that a `signature_topic` is a 32 byte hex string and not combined with an `anonymous` argument e.t.c),
  as well as diagnostics (and quickfixes) for deprecated entities and syntax (e.g. use of the `extension` attribute argument
  instead of the new `function` argument for chain extension functions,
  use of `additional_contracts` and `keep_attr` arguments for the `#[ink_e2e::test]` attribute macro e.t.c).
- Updated VS Code command for creating an ink! 5.0 project (i.e. with an ink! 5.0 contract stub/snippet).
- Code/intent actions for inserting code stubs/snippets for contextually relevant ink! 5.0 entities
  (e.g. an `#[ink::event]` annotated `struct`).
- Hover content/documentation for ink! 5.0 attribute macros and arguments.
- Inlay hints and signature help/parameter hints for ink! 5.0 attribute arguments
  (e.g. `u32 | _ | @` for ink! message selectors, `u16` for `function` attribute arguments,
  `node | runtime_only` for `backend` argument for `#[ink_e2e::test]` attribute macro e.t.c).
- Leveraging the new `#[ink::scale_derive(..)]` attribute macro when deriving
  [SCALE codec](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/) traits in related diagnostic/quickfixes and
  code/intent actions (e.g. for chain extension `ErrorCode` types and related input and output types).

Lastly, the latest updates also maintain ink! 4.x support by intelligently detecting the ink! version for the project!

section), and/or checkout the [ink! analyzer organization on GitHub](https://github.com/ink-analyzer) for:
installation, development, usage and testing instructions, library documentation, low-level technical and
architectural descriptions, access to the source code, and distributable releases of the ink! Language Server and
[VSIX packages](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#packaging-extensions)
for the VS Code extension (if you prefer not to use the VS Code marketplace) for most of the major platforms/architectures.

Special thanks to the entire Polkadot community for retroactively funding the above updates
(i.e. ink! 5.0 support for ink! analyzer) via the [Polkadot Treasury](https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/treasury/).
And as always, a big thank you to the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/) for previously funding
ink! analyzer's initial development via two generous grants.
