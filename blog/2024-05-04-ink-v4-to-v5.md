![ink! 4.x to 5.0 cover image](/img/ink-v4-to-v5.svg 'ink! 4.x to 5.0 cover image')

I am happy to announce new features for [migrating ink! 4.x projects to ink! 5.0][ink-v4-to-v5],
along with other major improvements, for ink! analyzer - a collection of modular and reusable libraries and tools
for semantic analysis of [ink!][ink] smart contracts.

## What's new?

The latest updates introduce features for [migrating ink! 4.x projects to ink! 5.0][ink-v4-to-v5],
along with other major improvements, across all ink! analyzer components including:

- Command and code action for [migrating ink! 4.x projects to ink! 5.0][ink-v4-to-v5] including:
  - Migrating ink! events to "2.0" syntax.
  - Migrating ink! chain extension attribute macro and associate `fn` attribute argument to ink! 5.0 syntax.
  - Replacing "built-in" `derive`s of `SCALE` codec traits with ink! 5.0 `scale_derive` attribute macro equivalents.
  - Migrating ink! e2e tests by:
    - Updating e2e `fn` signatures to include new `E2EBackend` trait.
    - Removing deprecated attribute arguments (i.e. `additional_contracts` and `keep_attr`).
    - Using new "builder" APIs and `ContractsBackend` trait for `instantiate`, `instantiate_dry_run`, `call`,
      `call_dry_run`, `upload` e.t.c.
    - Using new `ChainBackend` trait for `create_and_fund_account`, `balance`, `runtime_call` e.t.c.
    - Replacing deprecated `build_message` fn, `MessageBuilder` type, and related `call` callback with new API equivalents.
    - Removing ink! e2e deprecated imports i.e. `build_message`, `MessageBuilder` e.t.c.
    - Replacing `call` from `CallBuilder` via `build_call` with `call_v1` to preserve semantics.
    - Adding an `instantiate_v1` call before other method calls on `CreateBuilder`s via `build_create` to preserve semantics.
    - Replace `instantiate_contract` and `invoke_contract` with `instantiate_contract_v1` and `invoke_contract_v1`
      for direct calls in any function to preserve semantics.
    - Replace `instantiate_contract` and `invoke_contract` with `instantiate_contract_v1` and `invoke_contract_v1`
      for indirect calls via `Self::env()` and `self.env()` in constructors and messages to preserve semantics.
    - Replace `Call` constructors with `CallV1` to preserve semantics.
  - Migrating ink! project `Cargo.toml` to ink! 5.0 (i.e. updating `ink` and `ink_e2e` dependencies,
    removing `SCALE` dependencies and related features e.t.c).
- Completions for full ink! entities (i.e. inserting full Rust items not just ink! attribute macros and arguments
  e.g. ink! constructor and message `fn` items as completions when typing `fn` inside `impl` blocks e.t.c).
- Command and code action for extracting ink! events into standalone packages (only for [ink! v5][ink-v5] projects).
- Completions and code actions for `ink::combine_extensions!` declarative macro.
- Support for ink! workspace dependencies.
